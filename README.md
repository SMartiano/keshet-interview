This project is a web application consisting of both a client and a server. The client communicates with the server via API requests, and the server manages the backend operations.

## Installation
Each component (server and client) contains a README file with detailed installation instructions. The README for the server outlines the steps required to install and configure the server, including dependency installation and environment variable setup. The README for the client provides instructions for installing dependencies, configuring the interfaces with the server, and running the client application.
